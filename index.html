            A laptop is a portable personal computer that integrates most of the
            components of a desktop computer into a compact unit.

            Laptops run on batteries and are rechargeable, making them ideal for
            use while traveling. They come in various sizes, ranging from small
            notebooks to powerful gaming and business machines. One of the
            biggest advantages of laptops is their portability.

      <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Are you interested in learning about something on the Web? How about learning about my approach and my services, Rapid Software Testing? You could use a search engine to look it up. But there’s a problem; it’s ominous; and it goes way beyond Rapid Software Testing. It has consequences for the entire world of online search A few months ago, Josh Miller (CEO of The Browser Company) convinced me to switch my default search engine from Google to Perplexity. At first, I was skeptical. I kept going back to Google here and there, but then something clicked.

        I realized I have two types of searches: one where I’m just looking for a specific website and one where I need actual information. For the first type, I stayed loyal to Google. But for the second, Perplexity won me over… until Arc Search came along (more on that in a bit).
        
        Here’s the kicker: my website searches are pretty repetitive. So, my search engine (Arc, in this case) quickly picked up on my habits and started delivering results in a snap. The result? I haven’t opened Google in over a month.
        
        And it seems like I’m not the only one. According to the Wall Street Journal, Google could lose more than 50% of its online ad market share within the next 10 years. I tend to be an early adopter, so I wouldn’t be surprised if this shift catches on more broadly..</p></div>

        The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars, unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education( somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren’t actually visible….
        
        We need to completely revamp the system of education. Focus on work experience and adapting to a 21st-century skill set should be on the key agenda list…
        
        For this, the first step is reducing the burden on kids by deleting stuff from the syllabus, which almost 90% is irrelevant and students actually forget sooner or later and should be replaced with a practical and solution-centric approach to studies which will develop thinkers and leaders of tomorrow The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for India’s track to greater development.
